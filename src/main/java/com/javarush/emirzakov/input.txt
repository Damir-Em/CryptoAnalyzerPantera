When Al Templeton called me on the seventh of June 2011, and told me to come down to the diner, he sounded like a man who was gargling with nails.
He also sounded like he was about to cry.
Since Al was the toughest man I had ever known (my old man included), this was scary.
"What's wrong?" I asked.
"Are you sick?"
"Just get here, Jake.
Please."
He hung up.
I went.
He’d given me a job when I needed one, washing dishes and helping him short-order.
I owed him.
Besides, I was worried.
I hadn't seen him in...
when?
Mid-May, I guess.
That was when he'd put the CLOSED FOR REPAIRS sign on the door of the fat-boy diner.
When I asked him what repairs, he’d been vague.
The sign was still on the door, but the door was unlocked.
I went in.
The place was dark and hot.
The shades were pulled.
"Al?"
"In the booth," he whispered.
I walked past the counter, and my footsteps echoed in the empty room.
He was in the back booth, the one we called the Office.
He was sitting in the shadows.
"Al, what's going on?
You look..."
I stopped.
Because he didn't look.
Not like Al.
The Al Templeton I knew was a big man, six-two and at least two-thirty, most of it gut.
He was hearty.
He was loud.
The man in the booth was a scarecrow.
His cheeks were hollows.
His eyes were huge and staring.
His hair, which had been graying, was now almost entirely white, and it was thin, wispy.
He was wearing one of his endless supply of flannel shirts, and it hung on him like a tent.
He must have lost sixty pounds.
"Jesus, Al," I said.
"What happened to you?
Cancer?"
He nodded.
"Lung.
Stage four.
They found it when I...
when I came back."
"Came back?
From where?
Florida?
I thought you were just closing for repairs."
"I lied," he said, and his voice was a dry rasp.
"I haven't been in Florida, Jake.
I've been in 1958."
I stared at him.
He stared back.
His eyes were perfectly steady.
He meant it.
"You're insane," I said.
"No.
I'm dying.
And I need you to listen to me.
I need you to listen to me very, very carefully.
Because I’m going to tell you something that will change your life.
And maybe change the world."
He pointed toward the pantry.
"It started in there.
In the back.
There's a...
a bubble.
A rabbit-hole.
And it goes to the past."
