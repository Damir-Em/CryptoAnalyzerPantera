The portal to 1958 was not, Jake decided, a portal in the way you'd think of a physical hole. It was more like a tear in the fabric of time, a wound that had never really healed. He stepped through it and into a world that was both familiar and strange, a world where everything felt just a little bit wrong. The air was cleaner, the sky was a deeper blue, and the cars looked like they were from a museum. He was an anomaly, a man out of time, and he knew that any wrong move could have catastrophic consequences. He had to be careful. He had to be precise. His mission was too important.
Jake stepped out of the portal and into the mundane world of 1958. The year 1958 seemed to be a bit of a blur for Jake. He remembered it for some reason. For some reason, 1958 seemed to hold a particular fascination for him, perhaps because it was the year of his birth. As he stood there, taking it all in, he felt a profound sense of loneliness wash over him. He was a stranger in a strange land, a man who had left his own time to enter a time that was not his own. He was an anachronism, a relic of the future in a world that was still living in the past. He had to be careful. He had to be precise. He had to be careful not to make any wrong moves. He had to be careful not to make any wrong moves, lest the fabric of time tear even more, and the future, his future, come crashing down around him. He had to be careful. He had to be careful, lest the future, his future, come crashing down around him. He had to be careful. He had to be careful, lest the future, his future, come crashing down around him. He had to be careful. He had to be careful, lest the future, his future, come crashing down around him. He had to be careful. He had to be careful, lest the future, his future, come crashing down around him.
